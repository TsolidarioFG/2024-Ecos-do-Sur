msgstr "*Information about discrimination:*\n\n"
"*Discrimination* is when we are treated differently or denied a right based on our race, ethnicity, sex, religion... in other words, when there is no rational or justified reason.\n\n"
"Furthermore, *hatred towards people belonging to historically discriminated groups* makes common crimes more serious. This includes physical assault, harassment, sexual abuse, theft, threats, defamation, property damage, and all other crimes prohibited by law, which are more severe when it can be proven that they were committed out of hatred towards a person or group based on race, religion, gender/sex, sexual orientation, age, ethnicity, nationality, disability, etc. "
"Therefore, *having evidence and witnesses who can confirm that discrimination and hatred were the motive behind the crime, regardless of the crime type, is crucial*.\n\n"
"Discrimination is a crime, and access to rights is guaranteed by the [Constitution](http://www.derechoshumanos.net/normativa/normas/spain/LO/1995-LO-10-1995-CodigoPenal-Discriminacion.htm).\n\n"

"*\"The right of every person to equal treatment and non-discrimination is recognized regardless of their nationality, whether they are minors or adults, or whether they have legal residence\"*\n\n"
"To determine whether a problem or criminal incident can be considered a hate crime or discrimination, there is an Official State Council: [CEDRE](https://igualdadynodiscriminacion.igualdad.gob.es/redOficinas/portada/home.htm). "

"2. Another option is to file a complaint with the Social Security Inspectorate, which initiates an investigation into the company. To do this, you will need to provide your personal details. Your identity will be protected during the investigation, but you will receive information on the progress of the process. [Here](https://administracion.gob.es/pag_Home/Tu-espacio-europeo/derechos-obligaciones/empresas/empleados/seguridad-social/inspeccion.html#-ce27cd07198c) you can find more information about the complaint mechanisms.\n\n"

"Insults, threats, slander, assaults… These are illegal, punishable, and there are clear ways to assert your rights.\n\n"
"However, there are occasional behaviors from strangers that, despite being full of prejudice, are protected by freedom of expression and other individual liberties that are pillars of democracies.\n\n"
"We refer to things like “go back to your country”, “Spaniards first”, etc. Receiving bad looks, someone avoiding sitting next to you on the bus, or ... . These are hurtful actions, but that doesn't mean they're illegal.\n\n"
"*So… what can you do in a situation like that?*\n\n"

"- Look around you. Do you see any supportive looks? Any gestures of reproach towards the person offending you? Most people in Spain disapprove of discriminatory behaviors. And many don’t stay silent when they see them. Let the community support you.\n\n"
"- If you want to respond, avoid direct confrontations: you’re not going to convince a stranger in a minute. Simply, make them see that their behavior is rude and inappropriate.\n\n"
"- Try not to let your emotions take over: insults and shouting could escalate the situation. Humor, on the other hand, is a good tool in these cases.\n\n"

msgstr "✔️ *Hate speech* involves encouraging, promoting, or inciting, directly or indirectly, hatred, discrimination, or violence against a group or person based on racial, xenophobic, sexual orientation, and other forms of intolerance.\n\n"
"ℹ️ An example of hate speech is the *spreading of negative stereotypes* towards a racialized group online. Often, *disinformation* can foster hatred and discrimination. An example of this was the rumor that Chinese people do not pay taxes (completely false).\n\n"
"Hate speech, when often repeated, *can permeate society* to the point where it goes beyond words and influences behavior, for example, acting differently towards certain people. This is known as *discrimination*.\n\n"
"✔️ *Discrimination* involves differentiating or giving less favorable treatment when there are no relevant differences between people or situations, as well as giving identical treatment to people in situations that are actually different. Discrimination violates a person’s fundamental rights.\n\n"
"ℹ️ An example of discrimination would be asking a person about their religion during a job interview to assess them as a candidate (or not) for a job. This would be an illegal question that we should not answer, indicating that they are not evaluating us for the job based on our suitability, but rather on personal characteristics unrelated to the job performance.\n\n"
"✔️ Beyond these behaviors is the *hate crime*, which occurs when a person or group attacks another solely motivated by their belonging to a particular social group (real or perceived). This is a criminal act under the Spanish Penal Code (an assault, a robbery, an insult…) motivated by the perpetrator’s prejudices towards certain perceived characteristics in the victim: skin color, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, etc.\n\n"
"ℹ️ Example: A physical assault motivated by Islamophobia against a woman wearing a hijab.\n\n"
"As you can see, in these definitions *the key is the motivation*. Rejection of a traditionally discriminated group makes hate speech and crimes especially dangerous for coexistence and rights."

msgstr "🤬 Hate speech is not a new phenomenon, but the internet and social media have provided a new, often anonymous platform for disseminating ideologies that promote hatred based on real or fictional membership in a race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, etc. If you are attacked on social media for this reason, here are some tips:\n\n"
"1️⃣ *Consider if you want to respond:* In most cases, the best option is to avoid directly responding to hate speech. This can escalate the situation and lead to unnecessary confrontations. Always prioritize your safety and emotional well-being when confronting hate speech. If you want to give a fitting response, take your time and check out our [Practical Guide to Online Intervention for Cyberactivists, Ciberespect](https://www.idhc.org/es/publicaciones/ciberespect-guia-practica-de-intervencion-en-linea-para-ciberactivistas.php), developed by Ecos do Sur.\n\n"
"2️⃣ *Report the content:* Most social media platforms have options to report inappropriate content. Use these tools to report hate speech to administrators. You'll generally find a 'Report' button near the content you want to report.\n\n"
"3️⃣ *Block the user on your profile:* If the hate speech comes from a particular user, consider blocking them. This will prevent you from seeing their content in the future and reduce the likelihood of confrontations.\n\n"
"4️⃣ *If you want to take legal action, keep evidence:* If you consider taking other legal measures, you can take screenshots of the offensive content. These will be very useful when informing the relevant authorities.\n\n"
"5️⃣ *Support victims or seek support:* If the hate speech is directed at a specific individual or group, show your support and solidarity to help deal with this situation. If it's directed at you, seek support. *Entities like Ecos do Sur can assist you with this.* It's important to know that in severe cases of hate speech (involving threats or incitement to violence), it's crucial to report what's happening to the relevant local authorities. You can also contact the Council for the Elimination of Racial or Ethnic Discrimination ([CEDRE](https://igualdadynodiscriminacion.igualdad.gob.es/)) at 021, WhatsApp them at 628 860 507, or email them at consejo-sei@igualdad.gob.es.\n\n"

"1️⃣ *Calmly explain the situation* you are experiencing and demand a change in behavior from the person you feel is discriminating against you, for example, by offering worse treatment than other customers.\n\n"
"2️⃣ If there is no change in attitude, *demand to speak with the person in charge* of the place. Clearly explain what happened and how it made you feel. The manager may not be aware of the staff's behavior and may be willing to take action.\n\n"
"3️⃣ *Document the situation:* When making a complaint, it's essential to *take detailed notes of what happened, including the date, time, location, and names of the employees involved.* If possible, take photos or videos as evidence of discrimination.\n\n"
"4️⃣ *Seek witnesses:* If other people witnessed the incident, ask for their names and contact numbers. Their testimonies can be useful if you decide to take legal action.\n\n"
"5️⃣ *Submit a formal complaint:* Many bar and restaurant chains have a customer service department where you can submit a formal complaint.\n\n"
"6️⃣ *Share your experience:* Sharing your experience on social media or review sites like [Google](https://www.google.com/?hl=en) or [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/) can help raise awareness about the establishment's behavior and pressure them to make changes.\n\n"

Remember that if you have tried to enter a venue and have been unable to do so, you can also demand a complaint form.\n\n"
"The *fields* that need to be filled out for the complaint form to be complete are:\n\n"
"1️⃣ *Your details:* Name, surname, ID card (DNI), address, and contact telephone number.\n\n"
"2️⃣ *Details of the company or professional being complained about:* Trade name, company name, address, and telephone number. Ideally, this part should be filled out before the complaint form is given to you (or provided to you in some way).\n\n"
"3️⃣ *Full description of the incident,* including date and location: It's important to explain concisely what happened and write in uppercase letters. You can add a separate statement if you don't have enough space. Explain why you believe there was discrimination and what the reason was.\n\n"
"4️⃣ *What is requested:* compensation, apology, etc.\n\n"
"5️⃣ If necessary, *attach other documents.* If you have taken photos, these will serve as a basis for your complaint. You can print them out and include them when you submit the form.\n\n"
"6️⃣ Take the form to the Consumer Office. From here you can find the nearest [Municipal Consumer Information Office](https://cidoc.consumo.gob.es/directorio-mapas/oficinas-municipales-informacion-consumidor).\n\n"
"Once completed, you must return the corresponding copy to the establishment and keep two other copies. One of them must be sent to the competent Administration. This is usually the Municipal Consumer Information Office (OMIC) or the regional consumer authority.\n\n"
"The Consumer Administration will study your case and take action. They will contact the company to facilitate an agreement. If they fail to do so, they will check whether the company has violated any consumer regulations and, if so, initiate disciplinary proceedings that usually result in a fine.\n\n"
"Remember that you have the right to be treated with respect and dignity in all public spaces.

msgstr "If you suspect you are being denied entry to an establishment such as a leisure venue, bar, or restaurant due to racist, xenophobic, or religious reasons, try first to speak with the venue's staff to resolve the situation amicably.\n\n"
"1️⃣ Clearly explain your concerns, as well as your rights: *in Spain, discrimination is prohibited by law*.\n\n"
"2️⃣ *If they mention the right of admission,* which is the right of establishment owners to decide who can enter and who cannot, you should know that this *cannot be applied arbitrarily or discriminatorily*. Signs indicating 'Right of Admission Reserved' do not justify admission policies that discriminate against people based on their race, skin color, religion, gender, or other characteristics protected by law. *Discrimination in access to public establishments is prohibited in many countries and may have legal consequences for owners who practice it.* It's important for establishments to respect the rights of all individuals and not engage in discriminatory practices, so admission rules must be clearly displayed.\n\n"
"3️⃣ If, after this, you are still denied entry, it is crucial that you request the *COMPLAINT FORM* from the person in the venue (doorman, waiter, etc.), even if you have not entered or become a customer. It is your right. The complaint form constitutes evidence in the event of arbitration or judicial proceedings, so it is very important that you request it, as soon as possible and politely. When you fill it out, explain the reason given by the doorman or the person in charge for not letting you in. Try to include the time and place, as well as as many details as possible about what happened. *GO TO FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT COMPLAINT FORM*.\n\n"
"4️⃣ If they refuse to give it to you, *call the Local Police (092)* who will be responsible for processing the complaint for refusal to provide it or not having it available.\n\n"

"3️⃣ *Through judicial channels*. Particularly serious cases of workplace discrimination (salary differences, dismissals, etc.) may constitute a crime.\n\n"
"According to Article 314 of the Criminal Code: \"Those who cause serious discrimination in public or private employment against any person based on their ideology, religion or beliefs, family situation, membership of an ethnic group, race or nation, national origin, sex, age, sexual orientation or gender identity, gender reasons, hate of the poor or social exclusion, illness or disability, holding legal or union representation of the workers, for their relationship with other employees of the company or for the use of one of the official languages within the Spanish State, and do not restore the situation of equality before the law after an administrative request or sanction, repairing the economic damages that have occurred, will be punished with imprisonment from six months to two years or a fine from twelve to twenty-four months\"."
"Furthermore, if a hate crime occurs in the workplace, the judicial path is the appropriate channel.\n\n"
"Before filing a judicial complaint, it is advisable to seek advice from one of the organizations mentioned above.\n\n"
"In all provinces of Spain, there is a specialized prosecutor's office for hate crimes and discrimination and Victim Assistance Offices, which have legal and social personnel to assist you.\n\n"

"\t > 2️⃣ Try to remember and note any moment when there are indications that the situation may be related to discriminatory motives: verbal or written expressions; comments about your origin, physical appearance, or cultural customs.

"*Article 512 of the Penal Code.*\n\n"

"\t > Cases of discrimination that go unreported are not counted. Therefore, official figures of incidents do not reflect reality. Complaints help to reveal the true extent of discrimination in Spain. Thus, it's more likely that authorities will allocate necessary resources to advance rights.\n\n"
"\t > Your complaint can help prevent others from experiencing what you've gone through in the future. There are success stories where real estate agencies have committed to no longer handle discriminatory offers after a complaint.\n\n"

"*1. Document:*\n\n"
"\t > Keep all evidence of the discriminatory treatment you've experienced: emails, text messages, screenshots of rental offers, photographs, etc. Record details of comments about your origin, physical appearance, or cultural customs.\n\n"
"\t > You have the right to document your situation, such as by recording audio and video whenever you are part of the scene or conversation. If you choose to do so, ensure your safety is not compromised: try not to be seen. Do not edit any images or recordings you make.\n\n"
"\t > If there are witnesses to the events, gather their details in case their testimony is needed later.\n\n"
"\t > If you suffer physical or psychological harm due to harassment, collect any medical reports you have.\n\n"
"*2. Communicate:* Contact an organization in your area that works on defending rights against discrimination. They will provide free advice on the best way to file a complaint in your specific case and support you throughout the claims process. Additionally, they can bring media attention to your case for greater impact.\n\n"
"*3. Claim:* There are different ways and processes.\n\n"
"\t > Ideally, start with mediation through the supporting organization to try to reach an agreement with the company or individual who discriminated against you. Companies face significant fines if legally proven to have discriminated, so they may prefer to reach a beneficial settlement for you.\n\n"
"\t > If mediation fails or the case is severe, consider filing a formal complaint. In some cases, the burden of proof may shift: instead of having to prove you were discriminated against, the defendant must prove they did not violate the principle of equal treatment.\n\n"
